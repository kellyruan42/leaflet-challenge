# Leaflet-Challenge
## Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization

### Get dataset from USGS page
### Import and visualize the data by using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
### Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
### Create a legend that will provide context for my map data.
